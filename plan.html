                                        Come up with a basic schedule for what you'll make. You can limit waste – and save money – by checking what might be nearing the end of its shelf life and thinking of ways to use it.</li>

                                        Buying more than you need raises the likelihood of having food waste. "If you go overboard, 
                                        you may be wasting your money. Two weeks' worth of food per trip is a good target.

                                        One benefit to shopping online is some stores show you a running total of how much you're spending. 
                                        If you find yourself going over budget, you can make an adjustment. It's much more difficult to do 
                                        when you're in the store, trying to sort of add that up in your head as you go. You also may be less 
                                        distracted by point-of-sale advertising for things you don't need.

                                    • Understand what makes a balanced meal
                                    <li class="list-tips-item-sub">
                                        The bacis idea is to keep to dietary pattern that emphasizes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole 
                                        grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, fish, nuts and legumes, and non-tropical vegetable oils. 
                                        It also should limit saturated and trans fats, sodium, red and processed meats, added sugars and 
                                        sweetened beverages.

                                    • Avoid processed foods
                                    <li class="list-tips-item-sub">
                                        You might be tempted to stock up on ready-to-eat meals, but check the label. If you don't recognize 
                                        most of the ingredients, put it back. Think canned and frozen fruits and vegetables. Choose those 
                                        canned in water without added sugar, sodium or saturated and trans fats when possible. And, rinse them before using.

                                </li>

                                    • Have healthy snacks on hand
                                    <li class="list-tips-item-sub">
                                        One of the best things to do is to keep healthy foods available and out in the open. There has been plenty of research 
                                        that actually shows if you take a bowl of fresh fruit, and you stick it in the fridge behind the milk carton, 
                                        you are much less likely to walk by and grab an apple out of that bowl than you would be if that bowl was 
                                        sitting out on the kitchen counter.
                                </li> 
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-unstyled-item list-tips-item d-flex">
                                    • Adjust your cooking plans to your skill level
                                    <li class="list-tips-item-sub">
                                        Just because all your friends are suddenly baking their own bread from scratch doesn't mean you have to. Adjust your 
                                        cooking plans to your skill level. It doesn't need to be that complicated. Start with a list of five or six healthy 
                                        meals that you know how to prepare. Then, as time and your creative desires allow, start branching off. If you 
                                        understand the simple concept of a balanced plate and consuming different foods in moderation, it's really all 
                                        that's required to eat healthy.
